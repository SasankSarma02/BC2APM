Below is a pattern that works well when BusinessConnect (BC) runs only inside an on-prem DMZ while Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) lives in the cloud.
The idea is to drop a single, self-contained “migration agent” on the BC host (or a jump box in the same subnet) that can:

export every BC artefact without asking users to click a UI

transform it into a neutral JSON model you can inspect and version‐control locally

push (or stage for push) those objects into APM through its public REST APIs

1 What you can pull directly from an on-prem BC install
Method	Coverage	How it runs on the server	Reference
Export CLI bcengine -exportConfigRepo …	100 % of configuration (trading partners, certificates, channels, maps, etc.) as a single .csx file	Non-interactive; executes in seconds; can be invoked by any shell script or container entry-point	
TIBCO Docs
Trading Community REST API	~70 % (excellent for deltas after the full export)	HTTPS calls from the agent to http(s)://<bc-host>:9000/businessconnect/v1/…	
TIBCO Community
TIBCO Community
Database query (Oracle / MySQL)	Optional (message tracking, custom tables)	JDBC/ODBC read-only account; never touches config	product docs
RPA bot	Only if a GUI-only corner case appears	Run headless Chrome/Edge on the same host; bot code shipped with the agent	your existing RPA know-how

Why use the CLI first?
A .csx file is a ZIP of readable XML fragments – it is authoritative, versioned with a single checksum, and immune to UI/API changes.

Packaging choices that play nicely on-prem
Single OCI image containing:

OpenJDK 17 (for BC CLI and DataWeave JAR)

Python 3.11 runtime

Node runtime for the small UI

tini as entry-point → keeps the whole thing systemd-friendly

Provide an RPM/DEB for sites that forbid Docker.

Configuration in one YAML file (agent.yml) pointing to:

TIBCO_HOME

BC admin credentials (or OS user allowed to run the CLI)

APM client-ID/secret

HTTP(S) proxy if direct internet is blocked

3 Execution flow on the customer box
Step	What happens	Command / API	Runs as
1. Full export	Produce bc_full_<date>.csx	bcengine -exportConfigRepo	cron / operator
2. Canonicalize	Unzip → convert XML fragments to Partner.json, Endpoint.json …	Python script using xmltodict	same
3. Diff & approve	Agent UI shows coloured diff vs. last Git commit	localhost:8080	migration lead
4. Push to APM	For each object call POST /v2/partners, POST /v2/endpoints, …	HTTPS 443 → MuleSoft	agent
5. Save snapshot	Commit JSON + hash of APM IDs back to Git	git add && git commit	agent

If the server is inside a locked-down network: keep steps 1-3 on the BC host, scp the approved JSON bundle to a jump-host that has internet, then run step 4 from there using the same loader code.
